## [2.0.0] — 2026-08-17

### SecretLoom product release

- Renamed the derivative distribution and primary command to **SecretLoom**, while retaining the `stegoforge` command, module, payload marker, and local data directory for compatibility.
- Rebuilt the web interface as a responsive local-first workbench with grouped navigation, clearer task language, progressive disclosure, a command palette, deep links, and light/dark themes.
- Added carrier-aware method guidance, a cryptographically generated passphrase helper, and a diagnostic `/api/health` endpoint.
- Hardened the local Flask service with safe upload names, validated bit depth, opaque artifact IDs, upload-limit errors, same-origin operation, no third-party font requests, and restrictive security headers.
- Rewrote project documentation and added explicit upstream attribution in `README.md`, `NOTICE.md`, and the retained MIT license.
- Added PEP 517 build metadata and SecretLoom executable metadata for packaged releases.

## [1.1.5] — 2026-04-26

### 🛠️ Bug Fixes & Improvements
- **Debian Package Fix**: Added missing system dependencies (`python3-typer`, `python3-rich`, etc.) to the `.deb` package to prevent startup crashes on fresh Ubuntu/Debian installs.

---

## [1.1.4] — 2026-04-26

### 🚀 Distribution & CI/CD Enhancements
- **PyPI Hotfix**: Fixed missing `MANIFEST.in` asset inclusions for web templates, resolving PyPI build crash. Added `long_description` PyPI rendering and sidebar links.
- **PyPI Hotfix**: Fixed broken relative GIF image path in PyPI markdown rendering.
- **Native Debian Support**: Implemented a lightweight, zero-dependency `.deb` package generation workflow directly via GitHub Actions.
- **PyPI Publishing**: Added automated `sdist` and `wheel` distribution publishing to the Python Package Index.
- **Debian Standards Compliance**: Included `copyright` (LICENSE) and `README.md` documents directly in the `.deb` under `/usr/share/doc/stegoforge/` to comply with strict Debian/Kali Linux packaging policies.
- **Arch Linux Compatibility**: Updated the internal installation-kind detector to properly handle Arch's `/usr/lib/` packaging structures without flagging as a raw PIP install, preventing package manager conflicts.
- **Smart Updater Improvements**: Hardened the auto-updater to correctly recognize `apt` and system-managed installs (`system-package`), gracefully prompting users to update via their system package manager instead of `pip`.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-04-17

### 🚀 New CLI Commands

- **`stegoforge diff`** — Compare an original carrier against its stego version.
  Reports changed pixels / differing bytes, plus saves an amplified heatmap PNG
  that visually highlights every modified region.
  ```
  stegoforge diff -c cover.png -s stego.png
  stegoforge diff -c cover.png -s stego.png --save-heatmap heat.png --json
  ```

- **`stegoforge batch`** — Encode a payload into an entire directory of carriers in one command.
  Supported formats: PNG, BMP, TIFF, WEBP, JPG, GIF, WAV, MP3, FLAC, OGG,
  MP4, MKV, AVI, PDF, DOCX, XLSX, TXT. Displays a live Rich table with
  per-file status, method, capacity, and output path.
  ```
  stegoforge batch -d ./images/ -p secret.txt -k mykey
  stegoforge batch -d ./carriers/ -p msg.pdf -k mykey -o ./out/ --depth 2
  ```

- **`stegoforge completion`** — Generate tab-completion scripts for bash, zsh, and fish.
  ```
  eval "$(stegoforge completion bash)"    # add to ~/.bashrc
  eval "$(stegoforge completion zsh)"     # add to ~/.zshrc
  stegoforge completion fish | source
  ```

### ✨ CLI Enhancements

- **Stealth score** added to `stegoforge capacity` output — a composite 0–100 rating
  (weighted by chi-square resistance, RS resistance, ML evasion, and perceptual
  invisibility) shown as a colour bar for each method.
- **Smart capacity-exceeded errors** — when a payload is too large, StegoForge now
  shows the exact gap in bytes, then lists accurate suggestions:
  which `--depth` level would fit the payload, whether `adaptive-lsb` would help,
  and whether compressing the payload first is a viable option.
- **`STEGOFORGE_KEY` environment variable** — both `encode` and `decode` now fall
  back to this env var when `-k / --key` is not provided, so passwords no longer
  need to appear in shell history or CI scripts.
- **Interactive menu** updated with `d` (Diff) and `b` (Batch) entries.

### 🌐 Web UI Enhancements

- **Payload preview in Decode tab** — after successful decoding the payload is
  rendered inline: images show as `<img>`, audio plays via `<audio>`, text
  appears in a scrollable pane. No file-system access needed.
- **Smart download extension** — the Decode and CTF tabs now correctly name the
  downloaded file (e.g. `decoded_payload.png`, `decoded_payload.mp3`) instead of
  always using `.bin`, based on magic-byte detection covering 15 common formats.
- **CTF SFRG blob advisory** — when the blind extractor finds a `SFRG`-magic payload
  (a StegoForge-encrypted blob), the UI shows a clear advisory explaining how to
  decrypt it with the correct key.
- **Key strength meter** — live Shannon-entropy bar under every passphrase input
  (Encode and Decode tabs), scored 0-100 from length, character variety, and entropy.
- **Carrier image preview** — dropping an image carrier in the Encode tab shows
  an immediate thumbnail preview.
- **Mobile hamburger nav** — the header navigation collapses behind a hamburger on
  screens ≤ 600 px wide.
- **Artifact cleanup** — old web temp files (> 1 hour) are cleaned up on startup.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **B1** — Fixed `DeprecationWarning: Image.Image.getdata` in `core/image/palette.py`
  (Pillow 14 compatibility). Uses `numpy.array(img).flatten()` instead.
- **B2** — Replaced hardcoded `/tmp/stegoforge_stdin_*.bin` paths in `cmd_detect`
  and `cmd_ctf` stdin handlers with `tempfile.mkstemp()` for cross-platform safety.
- **B3** — Removed dead code block (unreachable dashboard panel after `return result`
  in `op_update`).
- **B6** — Web artifact temp files (prefixed `stegoforge_web_artifact_`) are now
  automatically deleted on startup if older than 1 hour.
